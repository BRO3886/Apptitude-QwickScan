## The Idea

The idea for this app was very simple. We go to supermarkets and nearby grocery stores even during this pandemic because getting suppies for home is absolutely essential.

A problem we found with the system here in India is that even though people sometimes follow social distancing, but in long queues, lack of pateince gets the best of us. Thus, we rarely see people following social distancing on cash counters.

So we came up with this app (..or you could say 2 apps). 

We have 2 apps- 

Qwickscan Client side, Qwickscan admin side

The client (or the person whos' grocery shopping) can add scan the items and quick add it to their cart. 
This cart is synced with our servers

Whenever they reach the billing counter, they can show a QR and the entire bill comes to the admin.

Now, the admin can verify the items or just process it ahead for payment.

In this way we reduce the queues and reduce paper waste generated by those long bills.

Thank You.

## Features

**Client Side**

- [x]  Login/Sign Up
- [x]  Splash Screen (Hack Requirement)
- [x]  Create Cart
- [x]  Adding items to cart (via TfLite object detection)
- [x]  Displaying QR code of Cart (every cart has unique ID)

**Admin Side**

- [x]  Splash Screen (Hack Requirement)
- [x]  Scan QR Code of Cart
- [x]  Displaying items in scanned cart


We also thought about integrating payment options for checkout after confirmation from admin, but due to the limited time, we could not do.
